<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>300g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
    <li>1 tsp fast-action dried yeast</li>
    <li>1 tsp caster sugar</li>
    <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
    <li>1 tsp olive oil</li>
    <li>1 white onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 tsp whole cumin seeds</li>
    <li>240g spinach</li>
    <li>50g firm goat's cheese, crumbled</li>
    <li>2 tbsp chopped dill</li>

</ul><h3>Method</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Put the flour, yeast, sugar and 1 tsp sea salt in a large bowl and stir to combine. Stir in 80ml water and the oil to bring everything together into a firm, smooth dough (you may need to add a little more water). Tip the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for 5 mins until the dough is smooth and elastic. Return to the bowl, cover and leave in a warm place to prove until it has doubled in size, about 1 hr.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, make the filling. Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium heat and fry the onion for about 5 mins until translucent. Add the cumin and spinach, and continue to cook until the spinach has wilted and any liquid has evaporated – this will take about 5 mins. Remove from the heat and leave to cool.</li>
    <li>When the dough has risen, heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and divide into four. Roll each piece into a ball, then each ball out into a rough oval, around 3-4mm thick. Transfer the dough ovals to a roughly 30 x 20cm non-stick baking tray.</li>
    <li>Spoon the cooled spinach filling into the centre of each dough oval, leaving a 2cm border around the edge. Sprinkle the goat’s cheese and dill over the filling. Carefully fold the sides of the dough in by about 1cm so they slightly overlap the filling, and bring the ends together to form a point. The ends may need to be slightly twisted and pressed down to fix them in place.</li>
    <li>When all four pide are assembled, brush the dough with beaten egg. Bake for 10-15 mins until the dough is golden brown and the filling is bubbling. Serve warm (any leftovers can also be eaten cold).</li>
